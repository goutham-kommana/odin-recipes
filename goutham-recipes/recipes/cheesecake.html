        <p></p>

        <ul>    
        <li>32 oz (907 g) full-fat Philadelphia cream cheese cold</li>
        <li>2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (236 ml) heavy cream cold</li>
        <li>4 large eggs cold</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>9" Springform pan</li>
        <li>72 oz capacity blender </li>
        <li>Parchment Paper</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>

        <h2> Instructions </h2>

        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange rack to middle of the oven (see note 2) and preheat oven to 325F (165C)</li>
            <p></p>

            <li>Line a 9” (23cm) springform pan all the way up the sides with parchment paper. 
                <br>The parchment should be extending at least an inch above the sides of the pan, 
                <br>I usually use two perpendicular pieces of parchment to achieve this.</li>
            <p></p>

            <li>Combine ALL ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.
                <br>You may need to stop and scrape the sides, you want to make sure there are 
                <br>no lumps of cream cheese that have settled on the sides or bottom.</li>
            <p></p>

            <li>Pour batter evenly into prepared baking pan. Repeatedly and firmly tap the pan 
                <br>against your countertop to help remove air bubbles.</li>
            <p></p>
            
            <li>Transfer to 325F (165C) preheated oven and bake for 35 minutes. Once time has elapsed, 
                <br> do not open the oven but increase oven temperature to 500F (260C) and bake for approximately
                <br> 5-10 minutes until the top of the cheesecake is deeply and thoroughly browned 
                <br>(watch the cheesecake through the glass with the oven light on, exactly how long this will take will vary 
                <br>depending on your individual oven but you don’t want the cheesecake to be completely charred).</li>
            <p></p>

            <li>Remove from oven, it should still be extremely jiggly. Allow to cool to room 
                <br>temperature then `transfer to refrigerator to chill overnight or for at least 5 hours before removing the 
                <br>ring from the springform pan, peeling back the parchment, slicing and enjoying.</li>
        </ol>
