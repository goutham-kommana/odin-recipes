        <h3> Ingredients </h3>

        <p></p>

        <ul>    
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 small zucchinis, diced (about 12 ounces)</li>
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 large carrot, diced</li>
            <li>4 ounces mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning herb blend</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoon salt, divided</li>
            <li>Freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 15-ounce container part-skim ricotta</li>
            <li>16-ounces frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 25-ounce jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>9 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>8 ounces shredded part-skim mozzarella</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>

        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9 by 13-inch lasagna baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <p></p>

            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, zucchini, onion, carrot, mushrooms, 
            Italian Seasoning, ¾ teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. <br>Cook, stirring often until the vegetables are 
            softened and any liquid has evaporated, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in basil.</li>
            <p></p>

            <li>Meanwhile, mix ricotta, spinach, egg, the remaining ¾ teaspoon salt and pepper to taste in a medium bowl.</li>
            <p></p>

            <li>Spread ½ cup marinara in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer on 3 lasagna noodles (they will expand when they cook.) 
            Add on half of the vegetables, spreading evenly. <br>Top with half of the ricotta-spinach mixture, spreading evenly. 
            Spoon on 2/3 cup sauce. Top with ½ cup cheese. Repeat with another layer of noodles, the remaining vegetables,
            <br> the remaining ricotta, 2/3 cup sauce and ½ cup cheese. Place the remaining 3 noodles on top and spread the remaining sauce over 
            the top ensuring the noodles are moistened with the sauce. 
            <br>Do not top with cheese. Cover the lasagna with a 
            layer of parchment paper and then cover with foil.</li>
            <p></p>
            
            <li>Bake until the lasagna is steaming hot, the top layer of noodles is fork-tender and the sauce is bubbling 
            along the edges of the baking dish, about 50 minutes. <br>Remove foil, top with the remaining cheese and bake 
            until the cheese is melted, 8 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <p></p>

            <li>Let cool 10 to 20 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
